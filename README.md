# :police_officer: PRcop

A Github action for linting Pull Requests.

## Available linters

**Title RegExp**. Checks your PR's title against a RegExp. Useful to ensure that title contains a Jira ticket ID.

**Description RegExp**. Checks your PR's description against a RegExp. Useful to ensure that description contains a link, an image, etc.

**Description min words count**. Ensures your PR's description is long enough. Useful to ensure that the author provided enough context and documented the most important decisions.

**Min number of author's comments**. Pull Request is also a tool for sharing knowledge. This linter ensures that the author left enough comments not just for a reviewer, but for the whole team to learn.
